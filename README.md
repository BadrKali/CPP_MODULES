# C++ Pool 42 Network

This repository contains my work and solutions from the C++ pool at the 1337 School. It showcases my journey of learning and mastering C++, focusing on foundational concepts, algorithms, and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

## ðŸš€ My Journey

I participated in the C++ pool at the 1337 School, where I developed a solid understanding of C++ programming through a series of challenging projects. The pool was an intense and immersive learning experience, where I honed my skills in:

- **Memory management** (pointers, references, dynamic allocation)
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**
- **Exception handling**
- **File handling** and working with input/output streams
- **The Standard Template Library (STL)**

The pool provided a hands-on learning approach with real-world challenges, pushing me to think critically and solve problems efficiently.

Each project aims to address different aspects of C++ programming, such as memory management, data structures, and algorithm implementation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

- Master C++ syntax and core concepts.
- Understand memory management in C++ (pointers, dynamic memory ...).
- Solve complex algorithmic problems efficiently.
- Build reusable and maintainable code using OOP principles.
